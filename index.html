            <h2>About Me (William Hennessy)</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is William Hennessy, but I like to be called by my nickname, Billy. I am a 2024 graduate from William Paterson Universiy with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in the Honors College's Social Sciences Minor Program.</p>
            <p>My main interests and hobbies include music, basketball, going to the gym, food tourism, video games, and electronics in general, whether that is software or hardware.</p>
            <p>I am looking to fulfill a role in Web Development or Software Engineering. To view the information about my projects, please click the "Projects" page above! It contains personal passion projects and education projects I have done.</p>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <h3>High School</h3>
            <p>In 2020, I graduated from Pompton Lakes High School with a 3.8 GPA and multiple achievements. These achievements include National Honors Society, Varsity Basketball Captain, and recieved multiple scholarships from our high school.</p>
            <h3>College</h3>
            <p>Now in May of 2024, I am finishing my last semester at William Paterson University of New Jersey and graduating. I have been enrolled in the Honors College for the entire course of my college career and have picked the Social Sciences Honors Track.</p>
            <p>I have attending civic engagement opportunities to stay active on campus.</p>
            <p>My most intruiging coursework includes: <em>Data Structures, Assembly and Programming Languages, Parallel and Distributed Computing, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Fundamentals of Networking and Information Security, Fundamental of Web-Based Information Technology, Operating Systems, and Software Engineering.</em></p>
            <h3>Why Computer Science?</h3>
            <p>Ever since I was a young boy, I used electronics all my life. Whether that was schoolwork, video games, cell phones, or other things. I was always fascinated by it and especially software because I had no clue how people created what we use every day and how they maintain it or make updates to it. One day in 2020, my brother (who was a garbageman at the time) came home with a PC that was being thrown out and decided to give it to me for my 18th birthday. I called a friend of my brother's to teach me about computer parts, software, how everything works together, and more. I then got into the world of PC parts, which sent me down a rabbithole and then I started to learn about software. It was intruiging to me and I decided, in my freshman year, to change my major from marketing to computer science. Nowadays, nothing feels better than all of my code runs smoothly and I create something from scratch. I would love to create something that I am passionate about and can help or be enjoyed by millions of people across the globe, and that is what I hope to do in the future, whether that is web development or software engineering.</p>
            <h3>Why Social Sciences?</h3>
            <p>Although Social Sciences isn't exactly related to Computer Science, I thought it would be a great idea to get out of my comfort zone of computers and electronics and be able to socialize and become much more educated on politics and our social history and climate throughout the United States. I am currently doing a research project for my thesis paper on inapporiate behaviors in online video games, and I hope to better the future of communication and teamwork in online video games, as well as educate the people who know nothing about the racism, sexism, and cyberbullying that goes on in video game lobbies.</p>
