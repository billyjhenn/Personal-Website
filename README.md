This website created in my Web Development class used HTML and CSS through Notepad and VS code to get the basics down of creating a website!

This website uses hyperlinks, images, navigation, and many other HTML functions to keep it organized.
I wanted to make a website that was a little more intimate than a resume website, so there are a few more personal things in this website, as well as a survey involving some of my interests!

I hope you enjoy.
